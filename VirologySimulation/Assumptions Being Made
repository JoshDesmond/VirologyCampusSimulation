Assumptions Made about simulation:

Lectures always begin flat at an hour, and will be assumed to last only one hour (rather, duration of class has no effect).

The simulation ticks at the rate of one hour per tick, and each exchange of sickness during 
each lecture will be simulated during that tick.

Assumes that students are 100% of the time going to class. 

A GlobalCourseSchedule can determine the state of all students at any given
 * time. The most important method avaiable is {@link #getLectureAtTime(int)},
 * which can be used by a student in its step method to determine who its
 * neighbors are.
 
 Question: Should resistance or health factor or susceptibility be normally distributed, or what?
 
 TODO checkout the classes and the number of people in them to make sure it makes sense. One of them was 0.
